My roadmap to ML Engineering. Practical ML, Computer Vision, object detection, engineering skills.

\# ML Engineer Roadmap



\## Goal

Become a strong ML Engineer intern / junior candidate with a focus on:

\- practical machine learning

\- computer vision \& object detection

\- engineering practices (reproducibility, clean code, pipelines)



\## Structure

\- `notebooks/` — experiments, EDA, learning notebooks

\- `src/` — reusable Python code

\- `data/` — datasets (ignored in git)

\- `reports/` — results, figures, notes



\## Progress log

\- Week 1: Environment, Python refresh, Git, tooling

\- Week 2: Classical ML (linear models, metrics)

\- Week 3: Trees \& boosting

\- Week 4: PyTorch basics

\- Week 5: CNN \& CV

\- Week 6: Object Detection (YOLO)

\- Week 7: ML Engineering \& MLOps basics

\- Week 8: Portfolio \& interview prep



\## Rules

\- Code over theory

\- Every week → working artifact

\- Every day → small progress
